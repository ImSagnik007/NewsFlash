It's a good practice to pull the changes from the remote repository before pushing your code, so you can make sure that you're working with the latest version of the code and avoid conflicts. To do this : 
1. git branch <branch_name>
2. git checkout <branch_name>
3. git pull origin <branch_name>

To upload : 
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "<commit_message>"
3. git push origin -u <branch_name>
4. create a pull request
5. check merging options for conflicts and merge
